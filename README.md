# hello-rustacean

This is a simple Rust project that uses the `ferris-says` crate to print out a message to the console.

## Project Creation

This project was created using the following command:

```bash
cargo new your_project_name
```

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run # This command compiles the code and then runs the produced binary.
```

If you don't have cargo installed, you can still run the program with the following command:

```bash
./target/debug/hello-rustacean
```

Other useful commands when working with Rust and Cargo:

```bash
cargo build # This command compiles and produces an executable binary in the target/debug directory.
cargo check # This command checks your code to make sure it's valid, but doesn't produce an executable.
rustc src/main.rs # This command compiles the file into an executable binary without using Cargo.
```
